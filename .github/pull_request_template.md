| WARNING: Please, read carefully before submitting a pull request |
|------------------------------------------------------------------|

Although this software is open source and we welcome contributions,
we believe these contributions should be preceded by an open discussion.
Open discussions tend to result in better solutions to any given problem,
and help maintain and improve the quality of the software.
If you would like to see a bug fixed or a new feature implemented,
please open an issue for the discussion rather than directly opening
a pull request.

If you would like to contribute please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](../blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

When you finally create a pull request, please follow these guidelines:

- Make sure the description clearly describes the problem, its solution, and references the associated issue;
- Do not create large pull requests (involving many different changes) because these are difficult to review. Instead, break large changes into smaller ones and create independent pull requests for each one;
- Use different pull requests for different issues. Each pull request should address a single issue;
- When fixing a bug or adding a new feature, make sure to add tests that cover your changes. This will ensure the changes will continue to work in the future;
- Verify that changes do not break the tests;
- Follow the same coding style rules as the rest of the code base;
- Pull requests for stylistic changes (or even simple typos or grammatical errors) may be rejected. Pull requests should always address worthy issues.
